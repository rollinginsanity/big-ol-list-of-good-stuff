# What is this?

This is just my way of starting to record a bunch of different things that I think are good, ranging from books to music to youtube channels. The main goal is being able have a handy reference for things whenever people ask me what I think is good (or when I want to share with someone)

I possess no specific "magic" when it comes to deciding if something is good or not, there's a lot left to personal opinion. If I know you and you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request. 

Also feel free to clone and change everything if you like the structure.

# Criteria

The following are the criteria that I have for adding items to this list.
 * The item has to be something I have experienced, read, listened to, watched or followed. It's not a "read later" list.
 * It needs to be something that I felt was worth while, or I thought was good, or enjoyed.
 * It needs to be something that I think others might also enjoy or appreciate. It's not a dumping ground for random stuff.
